# 🍎 Food Freshness Classification System

A deep learning–based web application that classifies food images as **Fresh** or **Rotten** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** integrated with a **Flask** backend.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project allows users to upload a food image and instantly receive a freshness prediction.  
It demonstrates the complete workflow of training a CNN model and deploying it using a Flask web application.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Image-based food freshness prediction
- CNN model trained on fresh and rotten food images
- Flask backend for model inference
- Simple and user-friendly web interface

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Flask  
- HTML, CSS  
- Git & GitHub
